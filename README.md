# Vsimulations

It is NOT run precise as real physic simulations! It is only demonstation what V + GPU can done ...
It is euler method with step 0.5 (big step is good for see dynamic but horible for euler method) and 128 planets (it is working for 4096 too, but it is slower) to compute on GPU in V.

This project uses https://github.com/vlang/vsl and https://github.com/irishgreencitrus/raylib.v
Many thanks to @raysan5 for the amazing Raylib, and to @irishgreencitrus for his excellent V wrapper. <br>
Mainly thank to @ulises-jeremias for excelent work on OpenCL wrapper.
